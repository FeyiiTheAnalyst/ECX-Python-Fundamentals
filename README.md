#  ECX Python Fundamentals Bootcamp Assignments

This repository contains core Python assignments, problem-solving exercises, and culminating projects completed during the ECX Bootcamp. These files demonstrate proficiency in basic programming structures, functions, conditional logic, error handling, and complex external library integration (APIs, GUI).



## Python Scripts & Projects

| Script Name | Purpose | Key Concepts / Dependencies |
| **Project 2a** (`project 2a.py`, `project2a.py`, `project2aforloop.py`) | Iterative solutions for a **Number Guessing Game**. | `for` loops, `while` loops, `if/else` |
| **Heart Rate Classifier** (`Project 2b.py`) | Defines a function to classify heart rate based on medical thresholds. | Functions, Conditional Logic (`if/elif/else`) |
| **Secure Login System** (`project2c.py`, `project2ci.py`) | Logic for a secure login process, demonstrating loop control keywords and debugging techniques. | `while` loop, `break`, `continue`, `pass` |
| **Exception Handler** (`exception_handler.py`) | Demonstrates robust **Exception Handling** (`try-except` blocks) for file and calculation errors. | `try/except`, Custom Exceptions |
| **Dictionary Client** (`eng_dict.py`) | A command-line dictionary application that interacts with a public API. | **API Calls**, `requests` library, JSON parsing |
| **Spotify Playlist Curator** (`Spotify_Playlist_curator_ECX.py`) | **Cappedstone Project:** An application to find top tracks from an artist or billboard charts and create Spotify playlists using the official API. 
| **Spotify API (Spotipy)**, **Web Scraping** (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`), Authentication |

### Requirements & Setup

To run the advanced scripts, you must install the required libraries:

```bash
# General libraries for advanced projects

# Required libraries for the Spotify Playlist Curator
pip install spotipy python-dotenv requests beautifulsoup4
